# Spam-Filter-for-Quora

Overview
This project implements a spam detection model for Quora questions using deep learning techniques. The model processes textual data, tokenizes and vectorizes the input, and utilizes neural network architectures, including LSTMs and CNNs, to classify whether a given question is spam or not.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares textual data, removing unnecessary features like qid and tokenizing questions for model input.
Deep Learning Model: Implements an LSTM-based neural network with embedding layers to learn patterns in textual data.
Evaluation Metrics: Uses accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC score, precision-recall curves, and other classification metrics to assess model performance.
Optimization & Regularization: Includes dropout layers, batch normalization, and L1/L2 regularization for better generalization.
Visualization: Provides insights into model performance using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow/Keras
Scikit-learn
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
